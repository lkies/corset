    "When characterizing an existing setup, it may not always be possible or desirable to remove all optics to take beam profile measurements. For these situations, Beam Corset also allows beam characterization with existing optics in place. Instead of using :meth:`Beam.fit <corset.core.Beam.fit>`, we use :meth:`OpticalSetup.fit <corset.core.OpticalSetup.fit>` which works similarly but also takes in a list of tuples of lens positions and optical elements."

To do this, we replace the lens position with a tuple of the estimated position and a maximum deviation from that position.

This works the same as normal mode matching, except that we pass an optical setup to the :func:`~corset.solver.mode_match` call instead in place the initial beam. The fixed optics do not participate in the optimization, but are still respected when propagating the beam through the setup. Since they are assumed to be immovable, they are also excluded from the analysis."
