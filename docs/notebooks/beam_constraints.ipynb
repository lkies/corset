    "In some mode matching scenarios, it is not only critical, that the final beam matches the desired mode, the beam must also fit through various other optics along the way. To account for this during mode matching, the relevant optics can be modelled as additional constraints on the beam radius at various positions. The solver will then only consider solutions that satisfy these constraints."
