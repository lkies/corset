In addition to that, we can also specify physical margins to account for the physical size of the lens and prevent overlaps. Finally, we can also give them a distinct name that will show up in plots and can be used to refer to them in lens lists. Thin lenses are modeled using the :class:`~corset.core.ThinLens` class."

    "Lenses may also be modeled as thick lenses, in this case we specify them by their input and output radius of curvature, their refractive index and their thickness. The signs of the radius of curvature follow the standard optics convention where positive radii correspond to surfaces that are convex when viewed from the input side of the lens. This means that a biconvex lens will have a positive input radius of curvature and a negative output radius of curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like thin lenses, we can also give thick lenses physical margins and names. The physical margins extend from the plane centered between the two surfaces of the lens and are independent from the optical thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the beam propagation model requires that the beam exits an element in the same axial position as it entered it, the ray transfer matrices for thick lenses include a negative amount of free space propagation before and after the lens. This way the sum of all propagation matrices that the element is made up of, is zero. One notable consequence of this treatment is that the calculated and plotted beam radius is not accurate for axial positions that are inside thick lenses. This also means that there may be a small discontinuity in beam radius across thick lenses in the plotted beam profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thick lenses are modeled using the :class:`~corset.core.ThickLens` class. For convenience and interoperability with thin lenses, the thick lens class also has a property :attr:`~corset.core.ThickLens.focal_length` that yields the approximate focal length calculated using the `lensmaker's equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens#Lensmaker's_equation>`_. Thick lenses cannot be described using a single focal length so this value should only be used as an estimate and not for calculations."
