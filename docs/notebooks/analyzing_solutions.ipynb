    "While every mode matching that achieves perfect overlap should be equivalent in theory, in practice some solutions are much easier to implement and align than others. If a lot of degrees of freedom are offered to the solver, there may be many possible solutions, and it can hard to sift through them all to find the best one. To help with this, Beam Corset calculates a variety of metrics and two kinds of analysis plots to help you find the most practical solution."

The strongly coupled (right) solution is pretty much the opposite of this, $x_1$ (orange) and $x_2$ (green) are almost perfectly aligned while $x_0$ (blue) only makes a small angle with them.

    "The sensitivity plot, as the name implies, shows how sensitive the mode overlap is to changes in the degrees of freedom or combinations thereof. The plot is a contour plot of the mode overlap as a function of displacements in the two least coupled degrees of freedom. If there are more than two degrees of freedom, the most sensitive remaining degree of freedom is varied in both directions and the resulting contour plots are visualized using different colors. If there are only two degrees of freedom the counter plot is plotted as a contour fill with the same color map as the reachability plot (see next subsection for an example of this). For three or more degrees of freedom only labeled contour lines are drawn to keep the plot readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to indicating the respective degrees of freedom, the axis labels also indicate the sensitivity of the respective degree of freedom and the title shows the coupling between the two primary degrees of freedom. And as with the reachability plot, the black dashed ellipse indicates the confidence region propagated from the fit uncertainty. In this case it should be interpreted as the corrections that might be necessary due to deviations from the fitted input beam parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range for the displacements is automatically chosen so that the 98% mode overlap contour is contained within the plot area. The computation is based on a heuristic so it is not guaranteed that the contour line is always fully visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mode matching only requires two degrees of freedom, solutions with more than two degrees of freedom are underdetermined. In the mathematical sense, this means that the sensitivity matrix is no longer positive definite, instead it has one zero (or close to zero) eigenvalue per extra degree of freedom. Practically this means, that deviations in one lens can be fully compensated by adjustments in the other lenses without any loss in overlap. This is why the different slices of the auxiliary degree of freedom have mostly the same contour lines. The range of the auxiliary degree of freedom is determined so that the minima within the slices are just within the plotting area. This is also determined heuristically, so the minima are not always guaranteed to be visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two sensitivity plots, we can see that the inner contour lines of the least coupled (left) solution are fairly circular while the contour lines of the strongly coupled (right) solution are extremely elliptical with non axis aligned major axis. This comparison is also reflected in the coupling values shown in the titles of the plots. This is in some sense the dual representation of the reachability plot, to go from the reachability plot, we distort the plot so that the two primary degrees of freedom are orthogonal and axis aligned. If they already were close to orthogonal the transformation is mostly rotating and scaling. However, if basis vectors were almost pointing in the same direction, the distortion needed to get them orthogonal is much larger which leads to these strongly elliptical contour lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we get farther away from the optimum, the quadratic approximation that a lot of the analysis is based becomes less accurate, and we can see the contour lines distort from their elliptical shape to much more complex forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect that is somewhat hidden by the automatic range selection is the sensitivity values shown in the axis labels. Due to the strong coupling, the sensitivities of the respective degrees of freedom is three to ten times larger in the strongly coupled solution compared to the least coupled solution."
